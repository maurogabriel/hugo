*[Verse 1]*\
It's easy when you know how\
To get along without Biff! Bang! Pow!\
And if I see you're fed up\
I'll stop and give you a leg up\
Overpriced unreal estate, surreal estate\
The highest price they've hit to date\
Creating new divides and tension

*[Chorus]*\
You've got to tolerate\
All those people that you hate\
I'm not in love with you\
You've got to tolerate\
Some of those people that you hate\
I'm not in love with you\
But I won't hold that against you

*[Verse 2]*\
This is a tale of two city/situations\
Mutual appreciation\
Away from narrow preconception\
Avoiding conflict hypertension\
Non-phobic word aerobic\
This was my domain\
'Til someone stole my name

*[Chorus]*\
You've got to tolerate\
All those people that you hate\
I'm not in love with you\
But I won't hold that against you\
You've got to tolerate\
Some of those people that you hate\
I'm not in love with you\
But I won't hold that against you\

*[Post-Chorus]*\
Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed\
Just suppose I juxtapose with you\
(I wanna get juxtaposed with you)

Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed\
Just suppose I juxtapose with you\
(I wanna get juxtaposed with you)

Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed\
Just suppose I juxtapose with you\
(I wanna get juxtaposed with you)

Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed\
Just suppose I juxtapose with you\
(I wanna get juxtaposed with you)

*[Chorus]*\
You've got to tolerate\
All those people that you hate\
I'm not in love with you\
But I won't hold that against you\
You've got to tolerate\
Some of those people that you hate\
I'm not in love with you\
But I won't hold that against you

*[Outro]*\
Let's get juxtaposed...
