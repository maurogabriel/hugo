Look at you\
You're my dream\
Are you all that you seem?\
Now you have what I need\
And what I believe\
Don't tell me you'll lose it\
'Cause I'll have to leave

Don't let me down\
Don't let me down\
Don't let me down\
Don't let me down

What do I have to give\
Until you let me live?\
You're all that I work for\
But that's not enough\
Do I have to die too\
To show you my stuff?\
Well, I give you my best\
So, why don't you understand?\
I'm passing the biggest test\
So, don't cry\
Lend a hand

Don't let me down\
Don't let me down\
Don't let me down\
Don't let me down
