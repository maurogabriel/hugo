Fly me\
Fly me to the moon\
And let me play among the stars\
Let me see\
Oh I wanna see what spring is like\
On a-Jupiter\
On a-Jupiter and Mars\
In other words, hold my hand\
In other words, darling, i love ya

Oh, fill\
Fill my heart with song\
I wanna sing for you darling\
For ever more baby\
You, are all that I long for\
Oh, all I long for\
Worship and adore\
Can't you see that I love ya\
I'm simply tryna tell ya\
That I care for you darling\

Oh, fly\
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly me to the moon\
And let me play among the stars...
